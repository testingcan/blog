Summary: What is the ideological underbelly of superhero movies?
Status: draft

Having watched *Joker* quite late in its runtime, I had already read most of what people had to say
about it: The preliminary media-scare about its glorification of violence to the rave reception it
received from many people. I went in to the movie, expecting not a revolutionary movie, nor a
revolutionary superhero (or -villain) movie. But even with my expectations lowered, I was struck by
one thing in particular: I found the question as to *why* so many people raved about the movie more
interesting than anything the movie had to say itself. Besides the obligatory compliments for
Phoenix's performance, I kept wondering what it meant that for so many people, the movie resonated
so deeply, which in turn got me thinking about the wider implications of the still present superhero
craze.  
It has been said before that the current superhero craze in mainstream cinema is akin to the Western
craze before, just a marketing coup that will in some years come to pass, after which people won't
remember much of the countless superhero films. Instead of relegating any explanations to marketing
geniuses, we could try to think of the superhero craze as a *Sign of the Times* and thus ask
ourselves: What does it mean that the highest grossing movie is a superhero movie, the blockbuster
to end all blockbusters (RogerEbert.com)? What does it mean that Marvel can churn out superhero
movie after superhero movie and people do not tire of it?  

I'll argue that the current blockbuster superhero movie we encounter is not unified under one genre.
The Marvel movies have been described as spy-thrillers, sci-fi comedies, adventure-movies, etc.
However for my analysis, the genre of the individual movies do not matter much, as I think that the
ideological value of the movies lie not in their primarily presented themes (distrust against a
turned-evil government branch, friendship, etc.), but in their *forms*. One common criticism against
the Marvel movies was the [lack of notable
villains](https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-villains-best-worst/), which in turn reveals the
underlying form of how many superhero movies function, i.e. if we strip away the plot machinations,
we can find that a majority of superhero movies tend to concern themselves with one particular
notion: The notion of *order*.  

## Order in superhero movies

The modern superhero primarily fights against *chaos*, whether it's the Avenger's fight against
the Chitauri and Loki in the movie of the same name, or the fight against Ultron in *Age of Ultron*.
In thats the villains of the Marvel Cinematic Universe encompass the same aspects as Noel Carroll
ascribes to monsters in horror movies: 

> In her classic study Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas correlates reactions
of impurity with the transgression or violation of schemes of cultural
categorization

This is a unifying factor of most supervillains as well. The villain can present themselves as the
anti to the hero, what defies the hero and their convictions, but the generality of the villains in
the MCU present themselves as *impure*. They are not necessarily "transgression[s] or violation[s]
of schemes of *cultural* categorization [emphasis added]" in terms of the audience's culture
categorization, but they *are* transgressional in the heroes' cultural schemes (note, that of course
this overlaps most of the time. Ultron's goal to plunge a part of the earth back into it to cause
human extinction would be a transgression to most people's cultural scheme or common sense for
example.) In that, the villains exemplify transgressions of a certain order and the subsequent
struggle of the hero against the villain is not so much a struggle between two (or many more)
characters, but a struggle between chaos and order, or if we'd want to spin it further and read it
more ideologically, the struggle is between a (the) *status quo* and a transgression of it.  

## The ideological transgression of Thanos

Nowhere is the struggle between the status quo and its transgression more evident than in the latest
and last Avengers movies, the double-feature (?) *Infinity War* and *Endgame*. Here the
supervillain to trump all supervillains, Thanos (who has been slowly introduced throughout smaller
scences in previous movies) wants to eradicate half of all life in the universe in order to combat
overpopulation, the effects of which he has experienced on his home-planet. In essence, Thanos sees
himself faced with an ecological catastrophe and seems to be the only one acknowledging and acting
on it.  
Now, we don't need to discuss the actualities of his plan, nor the moral implications of it. It is
clear that simply eradicating half of all life in the *universe* can be read as transgressive. While
there exist various online communities around the idea that Thanos was a bit right, the cultural
values of previous movies (as well as our actual current cultural schemes, thank god) are pretty
clear that this is essentially a big no-no.  
*Infinity War* lays out Thanos' plan and the heroes plan to stop it, but only combined with
*Endgame* does the notion of status quo and transgession really come to shine. While Thanos
ultimately succeeds in *Infinity War*, the whole of *Endgame* is dedicated to restoring the status
quo. Thanos represents the ultimate transgression, but what's notable is that the actual catalyst
for Thanos' plan, the ecological catastrophe brought on by overpopulation that Thanos did experience
on his home planet is never addressed as an actual problem, even after our heroes (unsurprisingly)
manage to revert back to the status quo. At the end of *Endgame* Thanos is defeated and while one or
two major characters died, we are right back at where we started. Note that it is not really that
important whether *individual* characters changed or died, as the transgressive reading of the
movies is not really impacted by individual fates.  
We don't have to think far ahead to be able to see the similarities between the catalyst for Thanos'
plan and our current situation. In 2019, when Endgame hit the movies and in 2018 when *Infinity War*
did, the ecological crisis we are currently facing was already long present in the public mind. We
could argue that the current generation i
