Summary: What is the ideological underbelly of superhero movies?
Status: draft
color: black

Having watched *Joker* quite late in its runtime, I had already read most of what people had to say
about it: The preliminary media-scare about its glorification of violence to the rave reception it
received from many people. I went in to the movie, expecting not a revolutionary movie, nor a
revolutionary superhero (or -villain) movie. But even with my expectations lowered, I was struck by
one thing in particular: I found the question as to *why* so many people raved about the movie more
interesting than anything the movie had to say itself. Besides the obligatory compliments for
Phoenix's performance, I kept wondering what it meant that for so many people, the movie resonated
so deeply, which in turn got me thinking about the wider implications of the still present superhero
craze.  
It has been said before that the current superhero craze in mainstream cinema is akin to the Western
craze before, just a marketing coup that will in some years come to pass, after which people won't
remember much of the countless superhero films. Instead of relegating any explanations to marketing
geniuses, we could try to think of the superhero craze as a *Sign of the Times* and thus ask
ourselves: What does it mean that the highest grossing movie is a superhero movie, "the most blockbuster
of all blockbusters"? [(Tallerico, 2019)](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/avengers-endgame-2019) What does it mean that Marvel can churn out superhero
movie after superhero movie and people do not tire of it?  

I'll argue that the current blockbuster superhero movie we encounter is not unified under one genre.
The Marvel movies have been described as spy-thrillers, sci-fi comedies, adventure-movies, etc.
However for my analysis, the genre of the individual movies do not matter much, as I think that the
ideological value of the movies lie not in their primarily presented themes (distrust against a
turned-evil government branch, friendship, etc.), but in their *forms*. One common criticism against
the Marvel movies was the [lack of notable
villains](https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-villains-best-worst/), which in turn reveals the
underlying form of how many superhero movies function, i.e. if we strip away the plot machinations,
we can find that a majority of superhero movies tend to concern themselves with one particular
notion: The notion of *order*.  

## Order in superhero movies

The modern superhero primarily fights against *chaos*, whether it's the Avenger's fight against
the Chitauri and Loki in the movie of the same name, or the fight against Ultron in *Age of Ultron*.
In that, the villains of the Marvel Cinematic Universe encompass the same aspects as Noel Carroll
ascribes to monsters in horror movies: 

> In her classic study Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas correlates reactions
of impurity with the transgression or violation of schemes of cultural
categorization

This is a unifying factor of most supervillains as well. The villain can present themselves as the
anti to the hero, that which defies the hero and their convictions, but the generality of the villains in
the MCU present themselves as *impure*. Thus the villains exemplify transgressions of a certain order and the subsequent
struggle of the hero against the villain is not so much a struggle between two (or many more)
characters, but a struggle between chaos and order, or if we'd want to spin it further and read it
more ideologically, the struggle is between a (the) *status quo* and a transgression of it.  
Nowhere is the struggle between the status quo and its transgression more evident than in the latest
and last Avengers movies, the double-feature (?) *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, which will serve as a
demonstration of the notion of *order* against *transgression*.

## The ideological transgression of Thanos

In *Infinity War* and *Endgame* the supervillain to trump all supervillains, Thanos (who has been slowly introduced throughout smaller
scenes in previous movies) wants to eradicate half of all life in the universe in order to combat
overpopulation, the effects of which he has experienced on his home-planet. In essence, Thanos sees
himself faced with an ecological catastrophe and seems to be the only one acknowledging and acting
on it.  
Now, we don't need to discuss the actualities of his plan, nor the moral implications of it. It is
clear that simply eradicating half of all life in the *universe* can be read as transgressive. While
there exist various online communities around the idea that Thanos was a bit right, the cultural
values of previous movies (as well as our actual current cultural schemes, thank god) are pretty
clear that this is essentially a big no-no.  
*Infinity War* lays out Thanos' plan and the heroes plan to stop it, but only combined with
*Endgame* does the notion of order and transgression really come to shine. While Thanos
ultimately succeeds in *Infinity War*, the whole of *Endgame* is dedicated to restoring the status
quo. What's notable is that the actual catalyst for Thanos' plan, the ecological catastrophe brought
on by overpopulation that he experienced on his home planet is never addressed as an actual problem,
even after our heroes (unsurprisingly)
manage to revert back to the status quo through the use of time-trickery. At the end of *Endgame*
Thanos is defeated and while one or two major characters died, we are right back at where we started.[ref]
Note that it is not really that important whether *individual* characters changed or died,
as the transgressive reading of the movies is not really impacted by individual fates.[/ref] And
while this is most clearly expressed in the double feature of Infinity War and Endgame, the struggle
between order and transgression is present in most superhero movies.  
But how can we make sense of
the disavowal of the ecological crisis in *Endgame*? By reading the movie's outcome ideologically,
we could argue that the adamant defense of the status quo suggests an implicit acceptance of it.
While, yes, the alternative where half of the universe is eradicated is obviously not that great of
a solution, the disavowal of the problem creates a blindspot where the status quo is readily
accepted but never questioned.  
We don't have to think far ahead to be able to see the similarities between the catalyst for Thanos'
plan and our current situation. In 2019, when Endgame hit the movies and in 2018 when *Infinity War*
did, the ecological crisis we are currently facing was already long present in the public mind. And
while the notion that a blockbuster picks up relevant political and social themes but does not
address them, is nothing new. The sheer impact of *Endgame* as one of the biggest blockbusters of
all time and the continuing domination of superhero movies that rely on the struggle between order
and transgression is however interesting, while not surprising. It is not really surprising to see a generation that is defined by
social instability and an ecological crisis looming on the very near horizon attracted towards
narratives that posit an implicitily *good* status quo that is unquestionably worth defending.
Similarly to how Stephen King argues for horror as inherently conservative, the transgression of
supervillains serve as a horrifying Other:

> Monstrosity fascinates us because it appeals to the conservative
Republican in a three-piece suit who resides within all of us. We love and
need the concept of monstrosity because it is a reaffirmation of the order
we all crave as human beingsâ€¦and let me further suggest that it is not the
physical or mental aberration in itself which horrifies us, but rather the
lack of order which these situations seem to imply. (cit. Carroll, 1990: 199)

What bigger proponent of order than the defense of it against a genocidal megalomaniac?

## The transgressive element in *Joker*

How does the Joker in his eponymous movie play into this struggle between order and transgression? If we read
superhero movies as struggles between order and transgression[ref]which I admit can be a huge
generalization[/ref], we could read the oppositely situated supervillain movie as a struggle
*against* order. Disregarding the question whether *Joker* glorifies its titular hero, the main
point we could take from its protagonists struggle is that the current order is deeply flawed. Arthur
Fleck, the name of the *Joker* prior to becoming him, is a disturbed loner who is suffering in a
"system that abandons him and treats him like trash" (Joker, 2019: p 113). [ref]which in the movie is
spoken as "*society* that abandons him..." - apparently improvised by Phoenix[/ref]  
No matter whether the movie glorifies its (anti-) hero, the ending of the movie shows the
transgression of the Joker celebrated by the masses, which, after he killed a talk-show host on live
TV embrace him in their rioting frenzy.[ref]Yes, I have read the theories that we can't really
believe what we see and I don't care[/ref] So does *Joker* represent an ideological counterpart of
the superhero movie and its glorification of the status quo? After all the movie seems quite adamant
in showing that the "system" is flawed.  
In form Joker really does seem as a reversal of the order vs. transgression narrative. The current order
is deemed inherently *bad*, not worth defending (and its defenders not worth sparing). There
are multiple transgressions in the movie and they all culminate in a social uprising
against the current system and its proponents (whatever they both may be). However the political ramifications of all of this remain as unexplored
as the implicit agreement with the status quo in *Endgame*. While the movie touches briefly on political
aspects (e.g. healthcare, poverty, etc.), the actual catalyst for the riots is transgressive on a
more common level; Robert DeNiro's talk-show host is not killed by Fleck/Joker because of political
differences, but because of an emotional outburst from Fleck. As well, the actual riots are not
politicized but mostly remain
a subservient aesthetic expression; it doesn't matter that Fleck is being heralded a hero by a mob rioting
against... something, as the actual emotional undercurrent is that he is finally accepted. The
catharsis of the movie is therefore not a political statement, but an emotional one.  
There is nothing wrong with using political aspects to further an emotional journey.
*Joker* is not so much a transgression of political and/or cultural values in order to challenge
them,
but a commodified transgression against a social and political order as the backdrop of an emotional
reaction.[ref]And in so doing it can also be read as the same
notion of *interpassivity* that Mark Fisher diagnosed in e.g. *Wall-E*: "A film like *Wall-E* exemplifies what Robert Pfaller has called 'interpassivity': the film
performs our anti-capitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume with impunity." (Fisher,
2008: 12)[/ref] I think it is therefore more apt to read the movie in the same psychoanalytical way
as I did for *Endgame*, where the social, political and ecological instability that dominate our
lives is more or less silenced in favor of a posited stable status quo that is neither worth
exploring, nor worth questioning. Both the superhero movie that employs the order vs.
transgression-motif, as well as its reversal in the supervillain movie operate (in part) by addressing
psychological fears in their audience, where Joker serves as a commodified rebellion against some
posited status quo[ref]What is also worth considering is the time period the movie is set in. While
apparently set in 1981, the movie constantly plays with anachronisms that make it seem more timeless
or set in an undefined time somewhere in the minds of the audience. See e.g. Jameson on Nostalgia
for this.[/ref] without exploring either the status quo or the alternative. In some ways it plays in
the same vein as other expression of rebellion that were and are commodified (think Nirvana) and
thus is an almost infantile rebellion against the order which is deemed bad from the get go.
